Hi! I'm João :blush: 

Hey, I'm João :) After 6 years working in academia, I decided to explore a new career as a Product Analyst. I thrive on understanding complex systems, making them understandable to others and figuring out the levers you need to push in order to achieve your desired outcomes. 

I currently work as a Product Analyst at N26, the bank you love to use. After getting my start in the Acquire segment, which handles customer onboarding, I am now supporting on Financial Crime Prevention topics, wtih a focus on Identity and Address Verification. My current mission there is to transform our BI resources and make them more user-friendly, empowering stakeholders to better self-serve.

On this profile I have a few old projects from when I did a Data Analytics Bootcamp (be kind, I've improved since then :sweat_smile:). My company Github can be found [here](https://github.com/JoaoFernandesN26).

Here are some of the things I've worked on in the last few months at N26:
- Tons and tons of SQL
- Creating and changing data models in Redshift using dbt + Jenkins
- Snowplow tracking
- Data viz with Metabase
- A/B testing (with Bayesian statistics)
- Customer onboarding
- Identity and Address Verification
- Stakeholder management
