Hi! I'm Jo√£o :blush: 

I'm a data analyst with a scientific background. I'm currently doing the Data Analytics Bootcamp at Ironhack to sharpen my skills before diving back into job searching. It's turning out to be really fun! :smile: You can check out my projects in the repos below.

Here are some of the things I'm learning:
- Python
- MySQL
- Data viz with Tableau
- Statistics
- Machine Learning
- A/B testing
