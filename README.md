Hi! I'm Jo√£o :blush: 

I'm a data analyst with a background in biology. I'm currently finishing a 6-month internship at a fintech company (N26, Berlin). On this profile I have a few old projects from when I did a Data Analytics Bootcamp (be kind, I've improved since then :sweat_smile:). My company Github can be found [here](https://github.com/JoaoFernandesN26).

Here are some of the things I've worked on in the last few months at N26:
- Tons and tons of SQL
- Creating and changing data models in Redshift using dbt + Jenkins
- Snowplow tracking
- Data viz with Metabase
- A/B testing (with Bayesian statistics)
- Customer onboarding
